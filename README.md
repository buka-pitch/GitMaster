This is how we can use GitMaster to replace this commands using inline args

-   git add files
-   git commit -m "commit msg"
-   git push
-   git push to branch (optional)

```html
./GitMaster -a <filename> -c <commit msg> -p (add branch name optional)
```
<img src="/Doc/img/img.png" />
default branch name is : main


# 

## change branch
change branch to another branch (checkout branch)
```
./GitMaster -ch branch_name
```
<img src="/Doc/img/branch.png">
